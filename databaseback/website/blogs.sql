(6,'Unlock Elegance: The Benefits of Renting Jewelry and Apparel','<p>In the ever-evolving world of fashion, the concept of ownership is taking a back seat as more individuals embrace the trend of renting jewelry and apparel. This shift towards a more sustainable and economically conscious approach has opened up a world of possibilities, allowing fashion enthusiasts to adorn themselves in exquisite pieces without the burden of ownership. Let&#39;s explore the myriad benefits that come with renting jewelry and apparel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. <strong>Access to Luxury:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renting jewelry and apparel provides the opportunity to access high-end and luxurious items that may otherwise be out of reach. Imagine donning a designer gown or flaunting a dazzling set of diamond earrings for a special occasion, all without the hefty price tag. Rental services make it possible to indulge in luxury without a long-term commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. <strong>Variety and Versatility:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most appealing aspects of renting is the ability to switch up your style effortlessly. Renting allows you to experiment with different looks for various events and occasions. Whether it&#39;s a black-tie gala, a wedding, or a casual weekend brunch, you can curate a wardrobe that suits every moment of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. <strong>Budget-Friendly Fashion:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renting jewelry and apparel is a cost-effective alternative to traditional shopping. Rather than investing in pieces that may only be worn a few times, you can allocate your budget to experience a rotating collection of fashion-forward items. This approach not only saves money but also aligns with the growing trend of conscious consumerism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renting contributes to a more sustainable fashion industry by reducing the demand for new production. The fashion industry is notorious for its environmental footprint, and renting is a step towards minimizing waste and promoting a circular economy. By extending the lifespan of garments and accessories, you actively participate in reducing fashion&#39;s impact on the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. <strong>No Storage Hassles:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renting eliminates the need for vast closet space dedicated to storing occasional wear. Say goodbye to the guilt of purchasing items that spend more time in storage than being worn. With a rental service, you can enjoy a revolving wardrobe without cluttering your living space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. <strong>Trial Before Commitment:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Renting provides the perfect opportunity to try out trends and styles before making a permanent commitment. Experiment with bold colors, unique silhouettes, or intricate jewelry without the fear of buyer&#39;s remorse. It&#39;s like having a fitting room at your disposal for an extended period.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. <strong>Perfect for Special Occasions:</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For special occasions that call for an extra touch of glamour, renting is the ideal solution. Wedding ceremonies, anniversary celebrations, and milestone events often demand elevated attire and accessories. Renting allows you to shine on these occasions without the long-term investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the era of conscious consumerism, renting jewelry and apparel emerges as a fashionable and eco-friendly choice. Embrace the freedom to experiment, explore luxury, and make a positive impact on the environment by incorporating rental services into your style journey. Unlock elegance without the burden of ownership and let your wardrobe reflect the dynamic, ever-changing world of fashion.</p>\r\n','uploads/Rectangle 95.png','','2024-01-06 14:35:11','SS',1,0),

(17,'Test One ','What is Lorem Ipsum? some Lorem IpsumÂ is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#39;Content here, content here&#39;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#39;lorem ipsum&#39; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Â  Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#34;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#34; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#34;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#34;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from &#34;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#34; by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don&#39;t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn&#39;t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore alwaysÂ \r\n','uploads/Picture1.jpg',NULL,'2024-02-29 13:03:26','SS',1,0),

Just remember to keep the focus on the dress and avoid overpowering it with excessive accessories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2. Hair and makeup: Coordinate your hair and makeup with the style of your dress and the overall theme of your photoshoot.

For a more relaxed and bohemian look, loose waves or a half-up hairstyle can be the perfect choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3. Shoes: Select shoes that complement your dress and are suitable for the location of your photoshoot. If you&amp;#39;re shooting on a sandy beach, opt for barefoot or flat sandals.

Props: Consider incorporating props that enhance the theme or mood of your photoshoot. For a romantic beach shoot, a bouquet of flowers or a vintage bicycle can add a whimsical touch.

Coordinate with your partner: If you&amp;#39;re having a joint pre-wedding photoshoot, coordinate your outfits with your partner to create a cohesive look.

Romantic Stroll: Take a leisurely walk hand-in-hand through a picturesque location, such as a park or botanical garden. This pose captures the intimacy and tenderness between you and your partner.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Dancing in the Moonlight: Plan your photoshoot during the golden hour, just before sunset, and sway to your favorite song while your photographer captures the magical moment. This pose exudes romance and creates a dreamy atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Playful Silhouettes: Experiment with silhouettes by standing against a beautiful sunset or a well-lit window. This pose adds a touch of mystery and intrigue to your photos, creating a visually stunning effect.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Whispering Secrets: Lean in close to your partner as if sharing a secret, and let your photographer capture the genuine smiles and laughter that follow. This pose showcases the joy and connection you share.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Remember to be yourselves and let your personalities shine through. The most memorable pre-wedding photos are the ones that capture the authentic moments between you and your partner. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to get creative and try different poses or locations that hold special meaning to your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n','uploads/BannerSmall-WP.webp','','2024-03-15 11:13:20','SS',1,1),

(32,'The Future of Bridal Fashion: Renting Stunning Wedding Dresses for the Modern Bride','&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;For the modern bride, the future of bridal fashion is all about renting stunning wedding dresses. Gone are the days of spending a fortune on a dress that will be worn only once. Now, brides can have their dream dress without breaking the bank or cluttering their closets. Online boutiques like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://srishringarr.com/&quot;&gt;SriShringarr&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; which specialises in dress rentals, help brides access a wide range of designer gowns at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The concept of renting wedding dresses not only benefits brides financially, but it also contributes to a more sustainable approach to fashion. Instead of producing endless amounts of dresses that may go to waste, renting allows dresses to be reused, reducing waste and environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, renting wedding dresses offers more options and flexibility for brides. They can try different styles and designs without committing to a purchase. This allows them to experiment and find the perfect dress that reflects their personal style and vision for their special day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Renting stunning wedding dresses is the future of bridal fashion, offering affordability, sustainability, and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Renting Wedding Dresses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Renting wedding dresses comes with several advantages that make it an appealing option for brides. Firstly, affordability plays a significant role. Wedding dresses are notorious for being expensive, often costing thousands of rupees. For many brides, this price tag is simply not feasible or practical. Renting a dress allows brides to have an elegant gown or lehenga without the hefty price tag. They can allocate their budget towards other equally important aspects of the wedding, such as the venue, catering, or photography.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly, renting wedding dresses promotes sustainability. The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to pollution and waste. By renting instead of buying, brides can actively participate in reducing the carbon footprint to help planet Earth. Renting allows dresses to be reused multiple times, which helps to minimize the production of new dresses and the subsequent waste generated. It&amp;#39;s a win-win situation for both the environment and the bride.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, renting wedding dresses provides brides with a wider range of options. We offer a diverse selection of designer dresses, allowing brides to find their dream gown or lehenga that perfectly aligns with their personal style and vision. This flexibility ensures that brides find a dress that makes them feel confident and beautiful on their special day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Trends in Bridal Fashion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bridal fashion is constantly evolving, and renting wedding dresses is a trend that is here to stay. More and more brides are recognizing the benefits of renting, leading to a surge in popularity for this option. T&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sustainability has become a significant trend in the fashion industry, and bridal fashion is no exception. Brides are increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their choices and are actively seeking ways to reduce waste. Renting wedding dresses aligns with this trend, as it promotes reuse and minimizes the production of new dresses. It allows brides to make a positive impact on the environment while still looking stunning on their big day.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rise of Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, and the bridal fashion sector is no different. However, in recent years, there has been a rise in sustainable and eco-friendly options for brides. Renting wedding dresses is one of these options, as it promotes the reuse of dresses, reducing waste and the need for new production.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Renting Wedding Dresses Works us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Renting a wedding dress may seem like a complex process, but with uit is actually quite straightforward.

The process typically involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browse and Select:&lt;/strong&gt; You can browse through the collection of dresses available for rent and select the ones that catch your eye. We provide detailed information about each dress, including size and rental price. You can compare options and choose the dresses you want to try.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure and Fitting:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the dresses are selected, you can schedule a virtual measuring session with our designer. We will make the necessary alterations to fit your size based on the measurements. This step is crucial to ensure the dress fits perfectly and meets your expectations.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select the Rental Period:&lt;/strong&gt; The rental period varies depending on your specific needs. By default, it is three days. Typically, brides can rent a dress for up to a week.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Return: After the wedding, the bride returns the dress to us. We provide an easy and hassle-free return. The dress is then professionally cleaned, thoroughly sanitized, and prepared for the next bride to rent.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Renting a wedding dress eliminates the need for storage and maintenance, as the dress is returned after the wedding. Brides can enjoy their special day without worrying about the logistics of storing or selling a dress they will likely never wear again.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Finding the Perfect Rented Wedding Dress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Early and Do Your Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding the perfect rented wedding dress, it&amp;#39;s important to start early and do your research. &lt;a href=&quot;https://srishringarr.com/lehenga_choli_on_rent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start browsing our collection now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Whether attending a glamorous event or a special occasion, renting jewellery allows you to indulge in luxury without breaking the bank. With many options, rental jewellery will enable you to experiment with different styles and looks without the hefty price tag.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of Renting Jewellery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;One key advantage of renting jewellery is the ability to wear high-quality, designer pieces that may otherwise be unaffordable. Imagine adorning yourself with breathtaking jewellery pieces with intricate craftsmanship, all without the long-term financial commitment. With rental jewellery, you can effortlessly enhance your outfit, exude confidence, and turn heads wherever you go.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep up with the trends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;It is an attractive option for fashion-forward individuals because keeping up with the latest styles is challenging. By renting jewellery, you can constantly refresh your look with on-trend pieces while staying within your budget. Whether you prefer classic elegance or bold and edgy designs, SriShringarr Fashion Studio offers a wide variety of options to suit your personal style.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of the hassle of storage and maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, renting jewellery eliminates the need for long-term storage and maintenance. After wearing a piece for a special occasion, you can simply return it, avoiding the hassle of cleaning, storing, and insuring valuable jewellery. This convenience particularly appeals to those who travel frequently or prefer a minimalist lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Comparison: Renting vs. Buying Jewellery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cost, renting fashion jewellery is a cost-effective alternative to purchasing it outright. While buying high-quality imitation jewellery can be a significant investment, especially for luxury brands, renting allows you to enjoy the same level of sophistication and elegance at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consider an example. Imagine you have a special event and want to wear a stunning Kundan necklace. Purchasing a Kundan necklace of comparable quality could cost above five thousand or even ten thousand rupees. However, by renting the same necklace for a fraction of the price, you can enjoy the same level of luxury without the long-term financial commitment. This cost savings can be significant, especially if you only plan to wear the jewellery for a specific occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, renting jewellery eliminates the depreciation that occurs when you own a piece as the value of imitation jewellery will diminish over time and become a dead investment. Renting allows you to enjoy the beauty of these materials without worrying about their long-term financial implications. This flexibility enables you to stay on-trend without fearing your investment losing value.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popular Occasions for Renting Jewellery &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Renting jewellery is particularly popular for special occasions where you want to make a statement. Here are some of the most common occasions where renting jewellery can elevate your look:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weddings and Engagements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Weddings and engagements are momentous occasions that call for exquisite jewellery. Whether you&amp;#39;re the bride, bridesmaid, or a guest, renting jewellery allows you to accessorize your outfit with stunning pieces that complement your style and enhance your overall look. From earrings to delicate bracelets, rental jewellery services offer an array of options to make your special day even more memorable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Functions and Parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Attending such events often requires dressing to the nines, and jewellery plays a crucial role in completing the look. Renting jewellery allows you to choose from a curated selection of statement pieces that are sure to turn heads and make a lasting impression. Whether it&amp;#39;s a sparkling American diamond necklace or a show-stopping Kundan necklace, rental jewellery can add a touch of sophistication and elegance to your ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date Nights and Romantic Getaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Date nights and romantic getaways are the perfect occasions to add a touch of sparkle to your outfit. Renting jewellery allows you to surprise your significant other with a stunning piece that will leave them in awe. From a pair of beautiful earrings to a delicate pendant necklace, rental jewellery can enhance your natural beauty and create a romantic ambiance for your special moments together.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Choose the Right Rental Jewellery Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to choosing the right rental jewellery service, there are a few key factors to consider.

(37,'Your Ultimate Guide to Discovering the Dream Bridal Lehenga: Tips, Trends, and Ideas for Every Bride-to-Be','&lt;p&gt;Are you a bride-to-be searching desperately for that stunning bridal lehenga that will make you look mesmerizing on your wedding day? You&amp;rsquo;re in the right place! This article will give you all the details about the enchanting world of bridal lehengas, packed with tips, trends, and inspiration to make your search easier and truly enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;From classic elegance to contemporary flair, bridal lehengas have various looks and feel. With many choices at your fingertips, clarifying what captures your heart is important. Whether your preference leans towards exquisite embroideries, bold colors, or contemporary designs, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you uncover the style of lehenga that reflects your personality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;We will also share advice on choosing the right fabric, finding the most flattering silhouette for your body type, and accessorizing your lehenga to achieve that picture-perfect look.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors to Consider When Choosing Your Bridal Lehenga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The first step is selecting the suitable fabric, as it influences the lehenga&amp;rsquo;s overall look, feel, and comfort level. Popular fabrics like silk, georgette, chiffon, and brocade each bring their own unique vibe. For example, silk exudes luxury and a regal essence, while the lightness of georgette and chiffon is perfect for those bright summer weddings. Be mindful of the season; heavier fabrics are ideal for cooler weather, while lighter options keep you comfortable in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Next up is the color palette. Your lehenga&amp;rsquo;s color should resonate with your personality and may even reflect cultural traditions. While classic red remains a popular choice, modern brides prefer hues, and you can also consider pastel colors or jewel tones! Select a shade that matches your skin tone and your wedding theme. If you are concerned about the photograph, bright colors can produce stunning images, while softer shades add a romantic touch.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to the silhouette, different styles&amp;mdash;A-line, circular, or mermaid&amp;mdash;offer diverse fits. An A-line silhouette is universally appealing, offering a wonderfully flowing effect, while a mermaid fit hugs your curves beautifully. We advise trying different styles to see what fits your preferences best. Here, comfort is also important; you want to celebrate the special day without any worry in the world!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridal Lehenga Trends You Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Miss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bridal fashion trends are constantly changing. One of the biggest trends making waves right now is the embrace of bold, unconventional colors. The days of traditional reds are fading &amp;mdash;these days brides are gravitating toward rich shades like royal blue, emerald green, and even striking black. These vibrant colors let brides express their boldness while maintaining that regal look. Plus, ombre effects&amp;mdash;where colors blend seamlessly from one to another&amp;mdash;are stealing hearts, adding a captivating depth to lehengas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Intricate embroidery works have also become all the rage among modern brides.
