INSTALLATION / CONFIGURATION
****************************

First of all, you need to have access to your MySQL database, or have some way
to create new databases and tables. That said...

1.  Extract files
    - extract the .zip to a local folder (i.e. 'C:\phpplanner')

2.  Upload the files to your site
    - upload the folder/files you extracted to the document root of your host (i.e. '/htdocs')

3.  Create the database and tables
    - the file "sqldump.txt" contains the sql queries to re-create the database
      and table structure.  Just copy/paste the text in that file into phpmyadmin
      or something similar to create the structure. Of course you can also read the file
      and create the fields by hand if you have to.

4.  Configure database connection and date/time variables
    - the file "calvars.inc.php" in the "include" folder contains the variables for your
      database connection, as well as the date/time formats you want phpplanner to display.
    - Set $TZONE to a predefined 3 letter abbreviation such as "EST" for US Eastern Standard Time
    - Set $HOFFSET to your GMT offset in hours. You have to convert your GMT offset into just hours
      (e.g.  The US Eastern Standard GMT Offset is "-0500" which would be just "-5" for $HOFFSET)

5.  (OPTIONAL) Customize CSS styles
    - the file "calstyles.css" in the "styles" folder contains the styles used for phpplanner

6.  (OPTIONAL) Customize images
    - the only images used are the "next" and "previous" month buttons, and the "add event" button
      they can be found in the "images" folder
